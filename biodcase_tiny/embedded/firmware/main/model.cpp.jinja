// This is a standard TensorFlow Lite FlatBuffer model file that has been
// converted into a C data array, so it can be easily compiled into a binary
// for devices that don't have a file system. It was created using the command:
// xxd -i model.tflite > model.cc

#include "model.h"

// We need to keep the data array aligned on some architectures.
